## About DB
**goVault**  is designed to provide quick and efficient access to data. Built with simplicity and performance in mind, that is perfect for applications that demand speed and low latency.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for rapid data storage and retrieval.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use commands for storing, retrieving, and deleting data.
- **In-Memory Storage**: All data is stored in memory, ensuring low-latency operations.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, built entirely in Go.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can pull the Docker image directly from Docker Hub and start using goVault immediately:

1. Pull the Docker image:
```
docker pull lif0/govault:latest
```

2. Create a `config.yaml` file with your custom configuration. Example:
```yaml
engine:
  max_threads: 4
network:
  address: ":7777"
logging:
  level: "debug"
  output: "./goVault/log/output.log"
  stdout: false
wal:
  flushing_batch_length: 100
  flushing_batch_timeout: "10ms"
  max_segment_size: "10MB"
  data_directory: "./goVault/data/wal"
```

3. Run the container:
```
docker run -p 8080:{port-from-config} lif0/govault:latest
```

4. Now your goVault instance is running and ready to use on ```localhost:{port-from-config}```.

### Usage

The grammar of the query language in the form of eBNF:
```
query = set_command | get_command | del_command

set_command = "SET" argument argument
get_command = "GET" argument
del_command = "DEL" argument
argument    = punctuation | letter | digit { punctuation | letter | digit }

punctuation = "\*" | "/" | "_" | ...
letter      = "a"  | ... | "z" | "A" | ... | "Z"
digit       = "0"  | ... | "9"
```

#### Basic Commands

- **SET**: Store a key-value pair.
  ```
  SET key value
  ```
- **GET**: Retrieve the value for a key.
  ```
  GET key
  ```
- **DEL**: Delete a key-value pair.
  ```
  DEL key
  ```
